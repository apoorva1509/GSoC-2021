<h1> Journal Open Review Workflow And Integration </h1>

## About the project

This project focuses on creating a functional pipeline which will consist of open submission and open review process before publishing articles in our CDLI journals dashboard. To implement  open journals in the system,  an appropriate workflow needs to be developed which is intended to be carried out using https://pkp.sfu.ca/ojs/ojs_download/ software. OJS(Open Journal System) is an open source solution to managing and publishing scholarly journals online. OJS is a highly flexible editor-operated journal management and publishing system. In addition to this, we intend to make further integration in the CDLI journals dashboard and display the endorsement of reviewers with published articles.
